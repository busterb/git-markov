git-markov
==========
Convert your boring, matter-of-fact commit messages into boring, nonsensical
commit messages. Haha.

Usage
-----
The syntax is similar to `git log`. Some things may not work, I don't know.

Installation
------------
Put the script anywhere in your `$PATH`. Also, ensure python is installed.
